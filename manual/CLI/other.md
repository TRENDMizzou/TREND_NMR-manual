### SVD test script

* #### CLI program

  `trendtest.exe` in all platforms

* #### Synopsis

  ```
  trendtest.exe [-r] [-f [outname prefix of trendmain.exe]]
  ```

* #### Description

  - `trendtest.exe` analyzes PCA results generated by `trendmain.exe` and `trendreconstruct.exe`.
  It saves a table of attributes for evaluating the SVD outcome in the 
  `prefix-svdtest.csv` file. Columns of the table are: Component, Size of singular
  value, cumulative contribution ratio, auto correlation coefficient, RMSD, and 
  Normalized RMSD, respectively. The last two columns are optional and depend on 
  whether `trendreconstruct.exe --rmsd` was executed.
  - Note that the `-r` option of `trendtest` process is based on the last run of `trendmain`.    

* #### Options

  * `-r`  
    `-r` reads all arguments used by `trendmain.exe`. When `-r` is used `-f` is 
    not necessary  
  * `-f [input prefix name]`       
    `-f` specifies the prefix of input files. This needs to be the same as specified 
    with the `-o` option when using the `trendmain.exe` program  


### Report script

* ### CLI program

  `trendreport.exe` in all platforms.

* #### Synopsis

  `trendreport.exe`

* #### Description

  - `trendreport.exe` generates an HTML report just in case the `trendmain` 
  was executed without turning on `--report` option.
  - Note that `trendreport` process is based on the last run of `trendmain`.
