## Coming Soon (~2017-5-15): 

#### `trendmaingui` and `trendmain` 
- Supports zooming in on the Region of Interest (ROI)      
- Supports Simens RDA format

#### `trendreconstructgui` and `trendreconstruct`  
- Supports ICA reconstruction  

### TRENDpro (a new package including TREND NMR, TRENDanalysis, TRENDset)  
#### TREND NMR
- An improvement of `trendmaingui` that is optimized for NMR  
- Auto file format detection  
- Supports zooming in on the Region of Interest (ROI)      

#### TRENDanalysis
- Supports various data fitting models, including fitting of
 <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> to binding isotherm  
- Supports various clustering methods of `trendmain` or `TREND NMR` results  
- Supports user-defined fitting  

#### TRENDset
- Works on a batch of titrations to determine the bindign isotherm of Kd
  of each titration, with ranking by <i>K<sub>D</sub></i>  
- Can be used to work on a batch of any data series and ranking the
  results on selected parameters
