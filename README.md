### Introduction:
Getting binding isotherms and time courses within minutes from complex
spectra and movies was recently introduced by TREND. It also
reconstructs simplified movies and spectra using just the components you
choose. 40 academic licensees from nine countries (and growing) now
enjoy these capabilities of the original package.
The new [TREND NMR Pro](trendpro/README.md) package specializes in NMR usages, saving time for
professionals. [TREND NMR Pro](trendpro/README.md) automatically computes the NMR spectral
trend of your interest and fits the curve of your choice to that trend
to get the parameter you need, e.g., <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> or rate 
constant (features of
[TRENDanalysis](trendpro/trendanalysis/README.md). 
En route, it automatically recognizes your NMR file type
and zooms to the spectral region you select 
(features of [TREND NMR](trendpro/trendmain/README.md)). You
can fit and rank a series of many titrations or reactions automatically
within minutes using [TRENDset](trendpro/trendset/README.md). 
For example, you can automate fitting of
series of 1D or 2D spectra to estimate KD, or another parameter, using
the appropriate equation. You can compare and cluster spectra of
complexes to rank binders using TRENDanalysis. The automation can
increase your productivity and insight, and thereby free you to think
strategically.
